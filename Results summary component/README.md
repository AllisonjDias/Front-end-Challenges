## My process

I started by adding the structure of the website using HTML, i created a container for the entire app and inside the container i divided it in two main parts: the header and a section. With CSS, i applied the project primary colors and main font. I used CSS Grid to separate the header and the section within the container, and Flexbox to style and organize the content inside the grid area.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive

### What I Practice

```css
header {
    grid-area: cabecalho;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```
